        <div class="project_text">Historical research and collaboration with the restoration team to restore the graffiti on the pedestal of the monument, applied during the August Cup (1991):
            Thousands of people gathered around the KGB building on Lubyanka Square, aiming to topple Dzerzhinsky's statue, viewing it as a symbol of the oppressive Soviet past. "Executioner," "Felix is finished," and other words were sprayed.
            Regarding the restoration project, which initially involved removing the graffiti entirely, my colleagues and I argued for their historical value as a monument to the attempt of democracy and justice in 1991 when the monument was painted with graffiti, toppled, and relocated from Lubyanka Square to Muzeon Park as a symbol of KGB repression. Preserving these graffiti was crucial to us, as a historical monument to the events of August 1991, and as an object that is a post memory bearer.
            Unfortunately, after 2017, the graffiti were removed. This illustrates how historical memory is constructed in Russia and how executioners are returned to pedestals. Felix Dzerzhinsky (1877–1926) was a Bolshevik revolutionary and head of the early Soviet secret police organizations, the Cheka and the OGPU, predecessors of the KGB.</div>

                Totalitarian aesthetics, which spread to all spheres of cultural life in the USSR in the 1930s, still holds great allure for researchers, who alternately compare Soviet art with the art of fascist Germany and Italy. However, the similarity in form and style does not make socialist art identical to fascist art, as the former is motivated differently.

                The second stage of implementing the Lenin Plan of monumental propaganda, widely deployed in the 1930s, did not aim to glorify past revolutionaries but was intended to idealize and immortalize contemporary heroes, the builders of a "bright future." Nevertheless, decorative park sculptures also became widespread, adorning the leisure spots of Soviet citizens – replicas of antiquity celebrating the cult of the healthy body, and memorial structures in honor of fallen revolutionaries: constant reminders of the "hard-earned" beauty of the present.

                The brief period of relative prosperity and economic growth between the two world wars, combined with skillfully conducted propaganda, indeed inspired faith in the imminent arrival of a "better era" – communism. Despite being far from the context of real labor life, the brilliant grotesque art of the 1930s gives the impression of a happy decade, a "beautiful era" that never truly existed.

For example, before the Bolsheviks came to power, Sergey Merkurov rarely exhibited his works in Moscow. He spent his entire student life abroad, studying in Zurich and Munich, exploring sculpture during trips to Italy, and familiarizing himself with examples in Paris and London. His early fees were paid for <a class="text_link" target="_blank" href="https://old.evnreport.com/arts-and-culture/the-sculptor-of-death-masks"> post-mortem masks</a> which he continued to make throughout his life and which can be seen at the memorial cemetery in Yalta, Novodevichy in Moscow, or in the Kremlin necropolis.

                From 1944 until the end of his life, Merkurov served as the director of the Pushkin Museum. Upon assuming the position, he intended to transform the museum into an analogue of the British Museum, proposing a program of transformations that included acquiring outstanding works from foreign collections and organizing extensive archaeological excavations in the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Egypt. However, it was under his directorship that the museum was closed and turned into a permanent exhibition of gifts for Stalin's 70th birthday.

                The paired busts of the leader of the world proletariat and his main inspirer adorned the exit from one of the platforms of the Belorussky railway station in Moscow. The sculptural portraits themselves are quite static, devoid of internal complexity. However, the most interesting aspect is the dramatic contrast between the easily recognizable portrait and the unarticulated block, with its meticulously polished glossy surface of black granite and the rough untreated surface of the granite block. As a result, there arises the effect of the "emergence" of the head from the primal chaos of the material—a favorite technique of Merkurov, as well as Michelangelo and the entire modernist movement. It is not coincidental that in domestic art history, Merkurov's mature style is still cautiously referred to as "academic," meaning restrained, smoothed out, and modern</div>

    <div class="about_item">My work as a researcher, curator, editor, and artistic practitioner delves into the multifaceted intersections of post memory, body politics, post locality, 
        and fluid identity in the ever-evolving landscape of contemporary discourse. To me, the body serves as a conduit for expression, post memory refracts experiences 
        and defines social and political choice, and post locality evokes a displacement that transcends conventional notions of belonging for all the outsiders seeking for a shelter. 
        Through my interdisciplinary approach, I strive to excavate the layers of history, culture, and personal narrative that inform our collective consciousness, offering a lens through which 
        to navigate the tumultuous terrain of the present moment and raise awareness on the mistakes of the past whether made by political, social or artistic systems.</div>
        
        <div class="about_divider"></div>
    <div class="about_item">I advocate for a shift towards values over ideology, recognizing that the pursuit of sense and empathy transcends the constraints of dogma. Through my practice, 
        I seek to interrogate the narratives that have long defined our understanding of the body, offering instead a more nuanced and inclusive vision that celebrates 
        diversity and complexity. By embracing the fluidity of identity and the multiplicity of experiences that comprise the human condition, I hope to engender a greater 
        sense of empathy and understanding, fostering connections that bridge the chasms of difference and division.</div>
        <div class="about_divider"></div>
    <div class="about_item">Perpetual inquiry persists as an enduring quest for understanding.

        <span id="more">
        <div class="about_divider"></div>

            <div class="about_item">Central to my practice is the development of a new artistic language, one that transcends traditional boundaries and embraces the fluidity of expression inherent
                 in our contemporary reality. By melding visual, textual, and performative elements, I seek to create immersive experiences that invite artists to engage with these
                  themes on a visceral level. Through exhibitions, publications, and collaborative projects, I aim to build a community of like-minded people sharing the same values 
                  and needs, fostering dialogue and reflection, cultivating spaces for critical inquiry and creative exchange in which alternative narratives based on personal memory
                   and experience can emerge.</div>
        <div class="about_divider"></div>
            <span class="about_item">In an era marked by the re-rise of totalitarian regimes, the body emerges as the last bastion of individual autonomy, a locus of resistance against the encroaching 
                forces of oppression. Yet, beyond its status as a site of political contention, the live human body serves as a bearer of mind and memory that shape our very sense of
                 self and identity. By dismantling the boundaries imposed by national based art, focused on specific local narratives, I endeavor to discover the universal values embedded 
                 within the corporeal experience, transcending cultural divides to uncover the shared humanity that unites us all beyond the borders of localities.  </span>

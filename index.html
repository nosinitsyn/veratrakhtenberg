    <div class="about_container">

    <div class="about_item">My work as a researcher, curator, editor, and artistic practitioner delves into the multifaceted intersections of post memory, body politics, post locality, 
        and fluid identity in the ever-evolving landscape of contemporary discourse. To me, the body serves as a conduit for expression, post memory refracts experiences 
        and defines social and political choice, and post locality evokes a displacement that transcends conventional notions of belonging for all the outsiders seeking for a shelter. 
        Through my interdisciplinary approach, I strive to excavate the layers of history, culture, and personal narrative that inform our collective consciousness, offering a lens through which 
        to navigate the tumultuous terrain of the present moment and raise awareness on the mistakes of the past whether made by political, social or artistic systems.</div>
        
        <div class="about_divider"></div>
    <div class="about_item">I advocate for a shift towards values over ideology, recognizing that the pursuit of sense and empathy transcends the constraints of dogma. Through my practice, 
        I seek to interrogate the narratives that have long defined our understanding of the body, offering instead a more nuanced and inclusive vision that celebrates 
        diversity and complexity. By embracing the fluidity of identity and the multiplicity of experiences that comprise the human condition, I hope to engender a greater 
        sense of empathy and understanding, fostering connections that bridge the chasms of difference and division.</div>
        <div class="about_divider"></div>
    <div class="about_item">Perpetual inquiry persists as an enduring quest for understanding.

        <div class="about_divider"></div>

            <div class="about_item">Central to my practice is the development of a new artistic language, one that transcends traditional boundaries and embraces the fluidity of expression inherent
                 in our contemporary reality. By melding visual, textual, and performative elements, I seek to create immersive experiences that invite artists to engage with these
                  themes on a visceral level. Through exhibitions, publications, and collaborative projects, I aim to build a community of like-minded people sharing the same values 
                  and needs, fostering dialogue and reflection, cultivating spaces for critical inquiry and creative exchange in which alternative narratives based on personal memory
                   and experience can emerge.</div>
        <div class="about_divider"></div>
            <span class="about_item">In an era marked by the re-rise of totalitarian regimes, the body emerges as the last bastion of individual autonomy, a locus of resistance against the encroaching 
                forces of oppression. Yet, beyond its status as a site of political contention, the live human body serves as a bearer of mind and memory that shape our very sense of
                 self and identity. By dismantling the boundaries imposed by national based art, focused on specific local narratives, I endeavor to discover the universal values embedded 
                 within the corporeal experience, transcending cultural divides to uncover the shared humanity that unites us all beyond the borders of localities.  </span>
